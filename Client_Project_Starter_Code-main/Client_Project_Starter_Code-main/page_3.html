    <p>At the University of Michigan, undergraduates and graduate students are considered first-generation college students if neither parent or guardian has completed a 4-year college or university degree.
    <br>This definition includes students with other family members (siblings, cousins, grandparents, etc.) who have completed a four-year degree. </p>
